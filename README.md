## Welcome 

Feature Box is a simple, elegant and super easy to use JS plugin which can make simple sentences become really dynamic and cool!

So to use this, all you need to do is :
#### 1.Create a #id element:
```html
      <div id="MyFeatureBox">
      </div>
 ```
 
#### 2. List the items with the **feature** class :
 ```html
      <div id="MyFeatureBox">
          <div class="feature">Good</div>
          <div class="feature">Better</div>
          <div class="feature">Great</div>
          <div class="feature">Best</div>
      </div>
```
#### 3. Specify the ID :
  You need to tell the animation to animate a pirticular Feature Box that you've created ( so that in case of multiple boxes, you can choose the one you want ). So you need to pass the **#id** of the feature box.
  Create an object and put the id as **fbid** .
  
```javascript
      settings = new Object({
          "fbid" : "MyFeatureBox"
      });
```    
    
##### You can also fiddle around with these 4 settings :

i) **gap** : The duration between change of the items ( in seconds )

ii) **time** : How quickly the change takes place ( in seconds )

iii) **opq** : Choose whether the item "fades away" when being pushed out; true if YES, false if NO. ( __opq - opacity__ )

iv) **opqt** : Choose how quickly the item "fades away" if opq is true

v) **classes** : This is an array of strings which are the names of classes that have to be used for feature items along with the **feature class** . Its sole purpose is customisability. __Eg__- If I wish to color my items blue,
```css
    .CustomStyle{
        color: blue;
    }
```
And in the JS
```javascript
    settings = new Object({
      ...
      "classes" : ["CustomStyle"]
      ...
    });
```   
    
The default values used are :
 ```javascript
    settings = new Object({
      "fbid" : "MyFeatureBox",
      "gap"  : 1,
      "time" : 1,
      "opq"  : true,
      "opqt" : 0.5,
      "classes" : []
    });
```
     
#### 4. Start the animation:
Now, everything's done! Call the animation:
```javascript
    initFeatureBox(settings);
```

and... Viola!


### A few little things you should know :
1) The css for feature box is dynamically generated by the JS, so even if you provide any style for it, there is a chance of it getting overridden. However you can change the code for your application.
2) The case is similar with .feature elements. You can alter the .feature class, but I'd recommed adding new styles through the **classes** in settings objects.
3) I'd suggest you to go throught my JS code so that you can further tweak it to your tastes!

Hope you liked it ! âœŒ
